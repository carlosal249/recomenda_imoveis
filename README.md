<h1 align=center> Recomendador de imoveis</h1>
<ul>
  <li>In this project, I created a recommendation system for properties in SÃ£o Paulo. The web application searches for properties on quinto andar, processes the data, and goes through a machine learning model, where it recommends the best properties based on my half hand made labels and half Active-Learning</li>

  <li>For this project I created a ensemble of ensembles, LightGBM + RandomForestClassifier</li>
  
  <li>The crawler i used to Colect data was Selenium, that automaticaly opens the browser, maximaze the window, and then start collecting data from the site!</li>
</ul>

<h1 align=center> Project Motivation: </h1>
I'm looking for a property to rent in sao paulo, but going around looking for properties takes a long time, so i thought there could be an easier way to accomplish this task, and so the app was born
